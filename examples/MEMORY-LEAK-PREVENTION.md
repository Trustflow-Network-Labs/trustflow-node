# Memory Leak Prevention Implementation

## Summary

Based on analysis of memory metrics showing a **3MB/hour sustained memory leak** and file descriptor spikes (13-138 FDs), comprehensive memory leak prevention has been implemented in the trustflow-node project.

## Key Metrics Analyzed
- **Memory growth**: 108.17 MB over 35 hours (3.1 MB/hour)
- **Peak RSS**: 153.09 MB
- **Goroutines**: Stable 6-8 (no goroutine leaks detected)
- **File descriptors**: High variance indicating cleanup issues

## Implementation Details

### 1. New Utilities Created

#### **`/internal/utils/resource-tracker.go`**
- Centralized resource tracking with automatic cleanup
- Stack trace capture for debugging resource leaks
- Periodic cleanup of old/unused resources (30min+ age)
- Support for files, streams, connections, buffers, channels

#### **`/internal/utils/cleanup-patterns.go`**
- Automatic cleanup management with context cancellation
- Memory pressure monitoring (85% threshold)
- Stream wrappers with guaranteed cleanup
- Timeout-based operations with automatic resource release

#### **`/internal/utils/buffer-pool.go`** (Enhanced)
- Safe buffer operations with automatic pooling
- Buffer content clearing to prevent data leaks
- Added `SafeBufferOperation`, `SafeWriterOperation`, `SafeReaderOperation`

#### **`/internal/utils/memory-leak-test.go`**
- Testing utilities to validate memory leak fixes
- Benchmarking tools for performance testing
- Memory growth detection and reporting

#### **`/internal/utils/integration-example.go`**
- Complete integration examples for P2P manager
- Demonstrates proper usage patterns

### 2. P2P Manager Integration

#### **Modified `/internal/node/p2p.go`:**

**Added to P2PManager struct:**
```go
resourceTracker       *utils.ResourceTracker     // Memory leak prevention
cleanupManager        *utils.CleanupManager      // Automatic cleanup
memoryMonitor         *utils.MemoryPressureMonitor // Memory pressure monitoring
```

**Constructor enhancements:**
- Automatic initialization of resource management components
- Memory pressure monitoring (85% threshold, 30s checks)
- Periodic cleanup routine (10-minute intervals)

**Stream handling improvements:**
- All streams now tracked with automatic cleanup
- Resource tracking with stack traces for debugging
- Buffered I/O operations for better memory management
- Proper cleanup on all exit paths (normal, error, panic)

**Shutdown improvements:**
- Graceful resource cleanup during shutdown
- Memory pressure monitor shutdown
- Force garbage collection before resource closure
- Comprehensive error reporting

### 3. Monitoring Enhancements

#### **Modified `trustflow-node-monitoring.sh`:**
- Added heap allocation tracking (`heap_allocs`, `heap_inuse_mb`)
- Enhanced CSV format for memory analysis
- Automatic memory statistics collection via pprof
- Better error handling and reporting

**New CSV columns:**
```csv
timestamp,pid,cpu_percent,mem_percent,rss_mb,vsz_mb,threads,file_descriptors,tcp_connections,goroutines,heap_allocs,heap_inuse_mb,active_streams,service_cache,relay_circuits
```

## Usage

### Automatic Operation
Once deployed, the memory leak prevention operates automatically:
- Resources are tracked and cleaned up automatically
- Memory pressure triggers garbage collection
- Periodic cleanup runs every 10 minutes
- Enhanced monitoring provides detailed metrics

### Manual Operations
```go
// Force garbage collection
memStats := utils.ForceGC()

// Get resource statistics  
stats := p2pm.resourceTracker.GetResourceStats()

// Manual cleanup of old resources
cleaned := p2pm.resourceTracker.CleanupOldResources(30 * time.Minute)
```

## Expected Results

### Memory Leak Resolution
- **Eliminated**: 3MB/hour sustained growth through automatic resource cleanup
- **Reduced**: File descriptor spikes via proper tracking and cleanup
- **Prevented**: Buffer accumulation through pooled, cleared buffers
- **Detected**: Early leak detection through monitoring and alerts

### Performance Improvements
- **Better throughput**: Buffered I/O operations
- **Lower latency**: Resource pooling reduces allocation overhead  
- **Stable memory**: Periodic cleanup prevents unbounded growth
- **Improved observability**: Detailed resource statistics and monitoring

## Monitoring Results

Run the enhanced monitoring script to see improvements:
```bash
./trustflow-node-monitoring.sh trustflow-node
```

Key metrics to watch:
- **RSS growth**: Should be flat or minimal growth over time
- **File descriptors**: Should remain stable, no sustained increases
- **Heap allocations**: Should show regular cleanup cycles
- **Resource stats**: Monitor via debug logs for leak detection

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
- `internal/utils/resource-tracker.go`
- `internal/utils/cleanup-patterns.go` 
- `internal/utils/memory-leak-test.go`
- `internal/utils/integration-example.go`

### Modified Files:
- `internal/node/p2p.go` (integrated memory leak prevention)
- `internal/utils/buffer-pool.go` (enhanced with safety features)
- `trustflow-node-monitoring.sh` (added heap allocation tracking)

## Testing

Run memory leak tests:
```bash
go test -v ./internal/utils -run TestMemoryLeak
go test -v ./internal/utils -bench BenchmarkBufferPool
```

The implementation provides comprehensive memory leak prevention while maintaining backward compatibility and performance.
